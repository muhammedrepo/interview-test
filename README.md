Case Study: Creating a User Accounts Activity Chart with React and Airtable API

Overview
My client, a digital marketing company, wanted a way to visualize their user's activity on their platform. They needed a system that would allow them to monitor the user's revenue, conversion rate, and impression rate using charts. The client had a large user base, so we had to create an efficient system to handle the data.

Challenges
I had to deal with the high volume of data, which made it difficult to manage. Secondly, I had to find a way to create charts to display the data visually. Finally, I needed to make sure that the system was user-friendly and easy to use.

Solution
To address these challenges, I decided to use React as the framework and Airtable API as the database. React is known for its efficiency and reusability, making it a suitable framework for handling large volumes of data. Airtable API allowed me to store and retrieve data efficiently and effectively.

I used the useEffect() hook to fetch the data from Airtable API, and axios to make HTTP requests. I used the map() function to loop through the data and create an array of objects containing the user's data. I then passed the data to the Card component to display it on the dashboard.

I also created several helper functions to calculate the user's revenue, conversion rate, impression rate, and chart data. I used the reduce() method to calculate the user's revenue, and the filter() method to count the user's conversion rate and impression rate.

Finally, I used chart.js to create charts to display the user's data visually. I passed the chart data to the Chart component to display it on the dashboard.

Conclusion
In conclusion, I was able to develop a user accounts activity dashboard that met my client's requirements. I used React as the framework and Airtable API as the database, which allowed me to efficiently and effectively manage the high volume of data. I also created a visually appealing and user-friendly system that helped my client to make informed decisions and improve their user's experience on their platform.
